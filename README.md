## Title

Polygonization of LineString Spaghetti Data

## Description

The basis for the missing persons search are appropriate map data. The large
space is divided by linestring into sectors in which the search itself takes place. This
work deals with the creation of polygons (sectors) from a set of linestring (so-called
polygonization). In the first part of the work, a search of algorithms and currently
available conventional tools is done. Subsequently, a polygonization tool is implemented
using the Java Topology Suite library.
